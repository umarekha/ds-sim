Distributed Storage Simulator (ds-sim) is a tool to estimate the durability, availability, and repair bandwidth of a distributed storage systems in a data center. In this tool, users can configure the hardware architecture, failure models, and software data distribution independently, and the tool will output how much data is lost, becomes unavailable, and how much bandwidth will be spent to recover the data during a specified amount of time.

For details, please see our paper "Lazy Means Smart: Reducing Repair Bandwidth Costs in Erasure-coded Distributed Storage".
